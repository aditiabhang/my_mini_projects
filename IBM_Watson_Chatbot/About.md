#### What is a Chatbot? ðŸ¤–
- Itâ€™s a software agent capable of conversing with users through some kind of chat interface.
- Typically, the chatbot will greet the user and invite them to take some action like asking it a question. When the user replies, the chatbot will parse the input and figure out the intention of the userâ€™s question. Finally, it will respond in a consequential manner, either providing information or asking for further details before ultimately answering the question.
